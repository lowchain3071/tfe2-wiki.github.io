# Happiness
Happiness is a game mechanic that determines among other things the speed of your citizens at their jobs.

## Happiness - Work Rate
---
The higher the happiness is, the faster your workers work. Happiness goes from 0-99, then :D and XD. The working rate at happiness 0 is 0.25x (between 0-99 seems to be linear), :D is 2.00x (100), and XD is 2.50x (125).

## Other Uses of Happiness
---
- Getting the happiness to 53 is one of the tasks in the scenario A New Beginning.
- Getting the happiness to 80 is one of the tasks in scenario An Interworld City.
- Getting to :D happiness for the first time gives you the Statue of Happiness building.
- Maintaining :D or higher happiness for 14 in-game days gives you the Beacon.
